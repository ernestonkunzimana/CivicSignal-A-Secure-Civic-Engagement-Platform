- Government feedback on data quality and actionability
- Document case studies of successful resolutions

**Technical Refinement**
- Improve Kinyarwanda NLP based on real usage data
- Optimize for Rwanda's mobile network conditions

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation - Rwanda Context

### Political Sensitivity
- **Risk**: Perception as foreign-funded criticism tool
- **Mitigation**: Position as governance strengthening tool, align with Vision 2050, engage RGB early, Rwanda-owned governance structure

### Digital Divide
- **Risk**: Excluding rural/elderly/non-literate citizens
- **Mitigation**: Voice-first design, SMS fallback, community validator network, integration with Umuganda

### Data Security Concerns
- **Risk**: Government hesitation on citizen data handling
- **Mitigation**: Rwanda-hosted servers, full compliance with Data Protection Law, government advisory board seat, regular security audits

### Sustainability
- **Risk**: Donor dependency, lack of local funding
- **Mitigation**: Government budget integration after pilot, revenue from API licensing for private sector, foundation endowment model

---

## üå± Sustainability Model
